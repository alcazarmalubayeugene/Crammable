## API Routes the Frontend Calls

All paths come from `ApiPaths` in `contracts.ts`. The frontend calls these via
`fetch()` — the backend team owns the implementation. Routes marked ⚠️ are not
yet implemented by the backend; the UI will show an error gracefully until they are.

| Endpoint | Method | Used by page | Backend status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/upload` | POST | `/decks/new` | ✅ Implemented |
| `/api/generate` | POST | `/decks/new` | ✅ Implemented (test mode) |
| `/api/decks` | GET | `/dashboard` | ⚠️ Not yet — reads Supabase directly |
| `/api/decks/[id]` | GET | `/decks/[id]` | ⚠️ Not yet — reads Supabase directly |
| `/api/quiz/[id]` | POST | `/quiz/[deckId]` | ⚠️ Not yet — questions generated client-side |
| `/api/quiz/result` | POST | `/quiz/[deckId]` | ⚠️ Not yet — results stored in sessionStorage |
| `/api/referral/claim` | POST | `/rewards` | ⚠️ Not yet |
| `/api/payment/submit` | POST | `/upgrade` | ⚠️ Not yet |
| `/api/admin/payments` | GET | `/admin` | ⚠️ Not yet |
| `/api/admin/payments/approve` | POST | `/admin` | ⚠️ Not yet |
| `/api/admin/payments/reject` | POST | `/admin` | ⚠️ Not yet |

> **Note for teammates:** When you implement a route, remove the ⚠️ above and
> update the corresponding page if it was reading from Supabase directly as a workaround.

## Supabase Client

The frontend uses `getSupabaseBrowserClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/browser`.

```ts
import { getSupabaseBrowserClient } from "@/lib/supabase/browser";
const supabase = getSupabaseBrowserClient();
```

Never use the service-role key on the frontend. Never import from `@/lib/supabase/server` or `@/lib/supabase/admin` in client components.

## New PC Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alcazarmalubayeugene/Crammable.git crammable
cd crammable
git checkout FrontEnd
npm install
```

Create `.env.local` in the root:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://gjrdlmxlqngqcnflygcp.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_dGN7NMHRmhnu9GfT25Jdhw_z6N2yPGD
SUPABASE_URL=https://gjrdlmxlqngqcnflygcp.supabase.co
```

Then run: `npm run dev`

## Notes for Teammates

- **Quiz questions** are currently generated client-side from the deck's flashcards.
  When `/api/quiz/[id]` is ready, replace the `buildQuestions()` call in
  `src/app/quiz/[deckId]/page.tsx` with a `fetch(ApiPaths.startQuiz(deckId))`.
- **Quiz results** are passed to the result page via `sessionStorage` (key: `crammable_quiz_result`).
  When `/api/quiz/result` is ready, add the submit call before the redirect in `nextQuestion()`.
- **Deck + flashcard reads** on `/decks/[id]` and `/quiz/[deckId]` query Supabase directly.
  RLS ensures users only see their own data. These are safe as-is until the API routes exist.
- **Auth headers** — all `fetch()` calls to protected routes use `authHeaders()` from
  `src/lib/api/auth-headers.ts`, which attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
